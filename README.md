## WAREHOUSE SIMULATION



### Introduction

<div align="justify"> The Al Hassan Ghazi Ibrahim Shaker Company has a long and illustrious history that spans over 70 years. Despite the challenges of the business landscape, the company has managed to thrive and become the exclusive agent for LG air conditioners in Saudi Arabia, however shaker group have two types of warehouses, first one is for a fully functional devices that they sell directly to customers, second one is for spare parts usually the spare parts could be classified into three types, type A which is small parts these are the minor parts that often need to be replaced, such as nuts, screws, fuses, sensors, and other small pieces, second is the type B which is medium parts  these are the parts that are larger and more important than the small parts, but not as big or complex as the large parts, lastly type C which is large parts these are the parts that are the most sizable and sophisticated, such as condensers, compressors, or major frames, as its shown in below figures. Moreover, the case study was conducted on the second type of warehouse as it was easy to understand and modelled.</div>



### System Description
<div align="justify">The system boundaries starts outside the warehouse where forklift load and gets inside the warehouse then unload the crates(the system entities), after being unloaded the sorting process starts where workers takes the unloaded crates and sorting it by putting each crate in its place in the warehouse, afterward the parts will be held in storage until someone orders it each part have different change of being ordered as A 50%, part B 30% and part C 20%, lastly if someone order one of the parts the last process starts which is preparation of the specific part that has been ordered or requested.</div>

### Results

### Conclusion
<div align="justify"> After performing the simulation and obtaining the results it shows that part B would be more likely to have the stacking problem, part A has the highest number out due to its high order, part C is unlikely to have the stacking problem. </div>

### Recommendations

<div align="justify">After interoperation of results some parts need to have less order because it might cause the warehouse to have some unnecessary or unneeded parts thus will result in holding cost and order or manufacturing cost.  </div>
